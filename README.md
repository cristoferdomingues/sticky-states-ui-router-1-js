# sticky-states-ui-router-1-js
A clone (but written in js) of Chris Thielen's sticky states that works with ui-router 1.0.0-beta.3

This repository is meant to help others with this issue: https://github.com/ui-router/sticky-states/issues/4

Chris Thielen of course gets all credit for the ingenuity of his ui.router plugin. Reading his typescript code and implementing it in a js angular provider was quite fun and I learned a lot from following his coding practices. Any mistakes made are mine, any successes are his. 

The typescript source I referenced is here: https://github.com/ui-router/sticky-states/blob/master/src/stickyStates.ts
and the ui-router version for which this all works for me is 1.0.0-beta.3, available here: 

https://unpkg.com/angular-ui-router@1.0.0-beta.3/release/angular-ui-router.js

At the time of this writing, this is the version used in the ui-router demos.
