# sticky-states-ui-router-1-js
A clone (but written in js) of Chris Thielen's sticky states that works with ui-router 1.0.0-beta.3

This repository is mean to help others with this issue: https://github.com/ui-router/sticky-states/issues/4

Chris Thielen of course gets all credit for the ingenuity of his ui.router plugin. Reading his typescript code and implementing it in a js angular provider was quite fun and I learned a lot from following his coding practices.
